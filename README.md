# cap - ClamAV Python

This project is an unofficial reimplementation of some of ClamAV's scanning functionality in Python.

The purpose is to be a lightweight, more 'portable' alternative to the official ClamAV program.

For more information, check out the documentation here: https://clamavpy.webflow.io/

Usage: 
extended_match in extendedmatch.py takes an extended signature and the (read) contents of a file
logical_match in logicmatch.py takes a logical signature and the (read) contents of a file
